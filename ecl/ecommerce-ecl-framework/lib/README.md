External Content Library DLLs
==============================

As the SDL Tridion/SDL Web DLLs are under license, you need to manually
copy these from your CMS installation.

The following DLLs are needed to compile the ECL providers:

* Tridion.ExternalContentLibrary.dll
* Tridion.ExternalContentLibrary.V2.dll
